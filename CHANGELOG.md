# Changelog

Every released version of Meerkat, newest first. Versions follow semantic versioning: a patch fixes, a minor adds, a major changes how you use it.

## 0.3.11 (2026-11-01)

- Hot fix: the key hints at the bottom of the results screen now always fit and keep quit and help
- finding places keep their line numbers
- the prompt file is named with the run's date and preset
- the package is ready to install with npm

## 0.3.1 (2026-11-01)

- README pictures: the running GIF is bigger with no empty block below it
- the results GIF scrolls slower, one row at a time
- GIF frames are trimmed of empty space

## 0.3.0 (2026-11-01)

- every update shows the yellow update line, including a fix published without a new version number
- AI prompt: press p on the results screen (or run meerkat prompt) for a file that hands every finding in full to an AI
- optional AI verification of findings (meerkat verify --ai-verify), fail-closed
- findings, logs and the prompt keep full text (no 200 character cut); every run saves run.log
